	//Nvm I scrapped this idea...
	//Having the functions in Mob seems good, but then how do I have the variables be part of Mob? I don't think I can. So it defeats the entire purpose.
	//Unless I have ALL the functions in Mob and call it like "Jumper Movement", "Basic Movement" etc. But I think it would just make it more of a pain in the ass. Maybe better performance, but idc.
