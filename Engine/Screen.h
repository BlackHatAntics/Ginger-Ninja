struct Screen //Nevermind, I don't think this shit will work. Cause I need to customize the items inside of each one. 
	//I would also need to change Wall and Ground to be functions of screen...
	//I mean, I suppose I COULD, but I'm too fucking lazy to do that.
	//I guess I'll just keep it how it is, and clutter up my game.cpp file with tons of fucking Screen functions.
	//Sigh. Idk man, I probably should just move that shit.
	//Wait, but honestly idk that it will work. I still need to somehow lay out which screens have how many walls & grounds. 
	//And there's no way to do that but in Game. So I would still need just as many game functions.
